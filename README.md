# Housing-Prices

Dataset is taken from House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques educational competition available on Kaggle which uses the Ames Housing Dataset compiled by Dean De Cock.

Project Objective : To gain a better understanding of feature engineering, encoding and preprocessing techniques. This project is work in progress , advanced machine learning algorithms are yet to be implemented on the dataset. 

I plan to compare among various advanced techniques like xgb , gbm and random forrest.
